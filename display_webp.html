<h1>View webp files</h1>
    On Ubuntu 20.04.
    <h2>gthumb</h2>
    <p>
        I'd forgotten about this but vaguely recall installing it before where it performed
        as an image viewer replacement, being able to move left and right between files, with
        a little more functionality and clutter than I was used to.
    </p>
    <p>
        It looks light-weight from <a href="https://itsfoss.com/webp-ubuntu-linux/">itsfoss</a>
        where they describe it as a <a href="https://itsfoss.com/image-viewers-linux/">
        photo viewer application"</a>.
    </p>
    <pre class="bash">sudo apt-get install gthumb</pre>
    <p>
        I can see it will take 32MB of disk on my relatively clean Ubuntu 20.04.
    </p>
    <h2>imagemagick</h2>
    <p>
        The popular batch processing tool. It requires 19.4MB of disk from me
        and <code>webp</code> which in turn needs 631KB.
    </p>
    <h2>GIMP</h2>
    <p>
        My go-to image editor, already installed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GIMP/comments/8g5036/gimp_210_i_can_export_images_as_webp_but_i_cant/">
        GIMP 2.10</a> already supports import and export.
    </p>
    <h2>Firefox</h2>
    <p>
        Brilliant. The default Ubuntu browser of course handles viewing, but only one at a time.
    </p>
    <h2>Eye Of Gnome</h2>
    <p>
        EoG is the default "Image Viewer" in gnome. <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1346951">
        This SO answer from June 2021</a> provides comprehensive instructions for enabling webp
        support. No need for scary PPA repositories, just one "little known"
        <a href="https://github.com/aruiz/webp-pixbuf-loader"> github repo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Requires some building, with <code>meson</code>, and <code>ninja</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>JPEG XL</h2>
    <p>
        I gleaned <a href="https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/">from the SO answer above</a>, by Pablo
        Bianchi. Lossless compression of jpeg, so essentially jpeg but better. If I hadn't
        just solved compatibility issues with the above options, I'd hold out for this.
