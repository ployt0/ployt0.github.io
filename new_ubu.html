<h1>Ubuntu Setup</h1>
<p>
I want to share how I like to setup my Ubuntu Desktop. I've been away from it for too long
and at the very least these notes should help me. The installation I'm running is Ubuntu 20.04.
I like things minimal so there were just a handful of applications showing under
"Show applications". (Please note not every app with an icon is displayed under this.)
It appears the full-fat installation has things I might want and you might have already.
</p>

<h3>System-Monitor</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet">gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet</a>
is the full name for what many simply refer to as "system-monitor". When I search the latter in "Ubuntu Software"
I see it is already installed! I cannot find it in the graphical "Show Applications"->All. It is a doppelganger.
</p>
<p>
So paradoxxxzero's is definitely it. How then do I obey myriad conflicting instructions and get it running with the
least fluff possible? Following the official <a href="https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet#readme">
README</a> seems a fair bet. So it is more accurately called, "gnome-system-monitor". It was updated a few months ago
in late 2021. The maintainer still cares.
</p>
<pre class="bash">
$ sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gnome-system-monitor
</pre>
<p>
It sells it to me at just 70kB.
</p>
<p>
Hmm, not seeing anything in "Show Applications", nothing in the setting panel either.
</p>
<p>
That was just the <b>pre</b>-requisites. Now I'm slightly confused by what follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser installation</li>
<li>Repository installation</li>
<li>Manual installation</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was disappointed to learn, "browser installation", lives up to its name.
It is offering <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/120/system-monitor/#">
Click here to install browser extension</a>. Altering the "<em>gnome shell status bar</em>"
is not my understanding of what a browser extension can do. I've never followed this
link before in the many Ubuntu installs I've done.
</p>
<p>
Stack Overflow to the rescue. I feel I've trodden this
path before and been a little peeved that I installed pre-requisites (however small)
for something I did not want nor need (despite its uncanny name). In his
<a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1116517">SO answer</a>, Tully writes to:</p>
<pre class="bash">
$ sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extension-system-monitor
</pre>
<p>
That used just 300kB more disk space. Nothing showing just yet but Tully advises choosing a path from:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Log out/in</li>
    <li>Reboot</li>
    <li>Restart gnome-session</li>
</ul>
<p>
I used <code>gnome-extensions enable system-monitor@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com</code>
from another answer in my efforts to avoid rebooting. Tully's was shorter but left
some room for confusion over what he meant by restarting the gnome session.
</p>
<p>
It works after much patience with: <code>sudo systemctl restart display</code>
</p>
<p>
I've since discovered other gnome shell extensions that require gnome session
restarts. <a href="https://itsfoss.com/display-weather-ubuntu/">
Pressing <b>Alt+F2</b></a>, and entering "r" will do it. Eventually. This does cause
programs to close.

<h3>Weather Widget</h3>
<p>
    Attempting this involved more exploration and hence was moved to its own
    page. <a href="no_key_weather_apps.html">Weather App roundup</a>, in short
    they all failed, which probably means I am expected to supply an API key.
    Android, watches, and Windows, all provide free weather updates, so I don't know.
